    and date, and other details about your usage.\n\nAdditionally, when you encounter
    certain errors while using the app, we automatically collect data about the error
    and the circumstances surrounding its occurrence. This data may include technical
    details about your device, what you were trying to do when the error happened,
    and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may not receive
    notice of such errors, even in the moment they occur, that they have occurred,
    or what the nature of the error is.\n\nPlease be aware that while this information
    may not be personally identifying by itself, it may be possible to combine it
    with other data to personally identify individual persons.\n\nDevice Data\nOur

    the Australian Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act. You acknowledge that if
    any such third party engages in any act or practice that contravenes the Australian
    Privacy Principles, it would not be accountable under the Privacy Act, and you
    will not be able to seek redress under the Privacy Act.\n\nAdditional Disclosures
    for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance (EU)\nData Controller
    / Data Processor\nThe GDPR distinguishes between organisations that process personal
    information for their own purposes (known as \u201Cdata controllers\u201D) and
    organizations that process personal information on behalf of other organizations
    (known as \u201Cdata processors\u201D). We, Kage Cat, located at the address
    provided in our Contact Us section, are a Data Controller with respect to the
    personal information you provide to us.\n\nLegal Bases for Processing Your Personal
    Information\nWe will only collect and use your personal information when we have
    a legal right to do so. In which case, we will collect and use your personal
    information lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. If we seek your consent
    to process your personal information, and you are under 16 years of age, we will
    seek your parent or legal guardian\u2019s consent to process your personal information
    for that specific purpose.\n\nOur lawful bases depend on the services you use
    and how you use them. This means we only collect and use your information on
    the following grounds:\n\nConsent From You\nWhere you give us consent to collect
    and use your personal information for a specific purpose. You may withdraw your
    consent at any time using the facilities we provide; however this will not affect
    any use of your information that has already taken place. You may consent to
    providing your email address for the purpose of receiving marketing emails from
    us. While you may unsubscribe at any time, we cannot recall any email we have
    already sent. If you have any further enquiries about how to withdraw your consent,
    please feel free to enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section
    of this privacy policy.\n\nPerformance of a Contract or Transaction\nWhere you
    have entered into a contract or transaction with us, or in order to take preparatory
    steps prior to our entering into a contract or transaction with you. For example,
    we need technical information about your device in order to provide the essential
    features of our app.\n\nOur Legitimate Interests\nWhere we assess it is necessary
    for our legitimate interests, such as for us to provide, operate, improve and

    your device in order to improve and personalize your experience of our app. We
    consider our legitimate interests to include research and development, understanding
    our audience, marketing and promoting our services, measures taken to operate
    our services efficiently, marketing analysis, and measures taken to protect our
    legal rights and interests.\n\nCompliance with Law\nIn some cases, we may have
    a legal obligation to use or keep your personal information. Such cases may include
    (but are not limited to) court orders, criminal investigations, government requests,
    and regulatory obligations. If you have any further enquiries about how we retain
    personal information in order to comply with the law, please feel free to enquire
    using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy.\n\nInternational
    Transfers Outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)\nWe will ensure that any
    transfer of personal information from countries in the European Economic Area
    (EEA) to countries outside the EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards,
    for example by using standard data protection clauses approved by the European
    Commission, or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.\n\nYour
    Rights and Controlling Your Personal Information\nRestrict: You have the right
